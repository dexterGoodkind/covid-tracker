# covid-tracker
Web app to track COVID-19 in different regions over time

## Module requirements

The web app uses python3 (flask) as a backend. The following python modules must be installed for the web app to run:
1. uk_covid19 (SDK decribed on https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/developers-guide/main-api) 
2. flask
3. numpy
4. matplotlib

## Running the web app
To run the web app:
1. Download this repo. 
2. Run main.py. A warning stating that this is a development server will display in the terminal. This can be ignored. 
3. While main.py is running, copy and paste the link displayed in the terminal into your web browser. 

## Tips
Within the web app, the user can go back to the home page using their browser's back button. Using this, they can change the start and end date to "zoom in/out" on the data they're interested in.
